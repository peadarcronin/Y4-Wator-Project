## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

C++ Compiler(See [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_environment_setup.htm) for instructions for your machine.)

### Running The Program

Clone the repository to a folder of your choosing using ```git clone https://github.com/eamonngaynor/CDDProject.git``` in your terminal. Navigate to the Concurrent Implementation folder and then enter ```make``` to run the Makefile and compile the program. Finally, enter ```./main``` and the simulation will run.

## Things to Note

This is the serial implementation stage of the project so no benchmarking yet. To generate the doxygen documentation, enter ```make docs``` into the terminal and they will be generated in the folder.
